There should be sensible guarantees against overwriting system memory, monopolising CPU cycles, and releasing malicious entities into the world.
The language must be inherently evil.

## Language Concepts
### Entities

Entities are the main structural units in a Wolf Lang program. They come in several types:
- Ranked:
  - Wolf.
  - Alpha.
  - Beta.
- Omega<br/>
Omega's should not be trust. They are known to twist the commands to suit them, while keeping to a strict literal interpretation.
If what is being used to keep the Omega under control is imperfect in anyway, it will be used against the controller.
- Pups
Pups are free-willed entities. They can often be commanded by a person who controls an object which is bound to them in an unbreakable connection.
Woe betide if you lose control of the object, however, since pup's harbour great grudges against those who dare to command them. Some of the most powerful code can grant wishes.

The safest entities to use are Ranked (thus the focus and name of the programming language). Other entities may be used though, to achieve more complex computing algorithms, but in such cases extra precautions need to be taken.

- Wolves
May be declared and then Asked. An Asked wolf can be expected to do whatever it is asked to do, straight away.
- Alpha
May be declared and then disturbed. A disturbed, and hence relentless, Alpha will eventually do what is asked of it.
- Beta
May be declared. They do not require Asking or disturbing, and will do what is asked of them, but not necessarily in the order requested.
- Omega
May be declared. They do not require Asking or disturbing. An Omega will do what is asked of it, if the proper precautions are taken, but may ask other entities to help it. This may or may not be a good thing.
- Pup
May be declared. They do not require Asking or disturbing. A Pup may or may not do what is asked of it.


### Threading

Wolf Lang runs in a multithreaded environment. Several entities may be Asked at once, and each may perform multiple tasks at once. The relative speeds and orders in which the entities perform tasks is undefined, and should not be relied on by the programmer.
Entities and their tasks may be active or inactive. An active entity is one which has been asked, disturbed, or is free-willed. A wolf or alpha that has been Asked and bound is inactive. An active task is one that has been asked to ACT; an inactive task is one that has been bound, or that the entity has completed.

All the active entities in a Wolf Lang program process their active tasks.

- Wolves process their active tasks in sequence, beginning from the first task defined, as quickly as they can. They perform each task exactly once.

- Alpha's process their active tasks in sequence, beginning from the first task defined, but they may wait for an undefined time before beginning and between each task. They eventually perform each task exactly once.

- Beta's process their active tasks in random order, as quickly as they can. They perform each task exactly once, and complete one task before beginning the next.

- Omega's process their active tasks in random order, as quickly as they can. They may decide to perform tasks multiple times before becoming inactive, but will perform each task at least once. They may perform multiple tasks at the same time. They may also summon additional demons exactly like themselves.

- Pup's process their active tasks in random order, as quickly as they can. They may decide to perform each task multiple times, or not at all, before becoming inactive. They may perform multiple tasks at the same time.
Comments

## Syntax Elements

Wolf Lang programs are in the form of a list of entity declarations. Entities may be declared in any order, and declarations are completed before any entities are activated.
Note that syntax errors in Wolf Lang programs can be extremely dangerous, especially if Omega's or Pup's are invoked. These enitities may escape the CPU and wreak havoc in the outside world without the correct binding commands. The language author recommends all computers with Wolf Lang code be checked by a licensed professional. 

### Data Values

Data values are free format arithmetic or string expressions, conforming to standard rules. Typing is weak. String and numeric values are converted implicitly as required, in a "sensible" manner.
Ranked can remember exactly one data value, either numeric or string. If multiple copies of the same entity are invoked, they all remember the same data value - if one copy remembers a new value, the value remembered by all copies changes to the new value.

### Entity Declaration

Entities are the basic elements of a Wolf Lang program. Valid Wolf Lang programs must declare at least one entity.
Entities are declared with the following structure:

```entity-name is [a|an] entity-type { entity-statements }```

Entity-type is one of the following:

- ```Wolf|wild animal```
- ```Alpha|top dog```
- ```Beta|second in charge```
- ```Omega```
- ```Pup```
Entity-name is any well-formed identifier string.

Entity-statements is a list of any valid statements, which may include entity declarations.

### Entity Declaration Statements

Some statements delineate matched pairs, which may be nested to any level. All the following combinations are properly matched pairs:
```
ASK / ACT
ASK / BIND
ASK / DISTURB
TASK / ACT
TASK / BIND
```
The following statements are used to declare entities:
- ```ACT```
This statement concludes a summon or task. When concluding a summon, it concludes the entity summoning and, if a zombie, makes the entity active. It does not make other entities active. When concluding a task, it ends the command definition and marks that command as an active command for new entities.
- ```BIND```
This statement concludes a summon or task. When concluding a summon, it concludes the entity summoning, leaving the entity inactive if it is a zombie or ghost. When concluding a task, it ends the command definition and marks that command as an inactive command for new entities.
- ```TASK task-name```
This statement defines a new task named task-name. The task statements appear after this statement and before the next matching animate or bind statement.
- ```DISTURB```
This statement concludes a summon and, if a ghost, makes the entity active. It does not make other entities active.
- ```ASK```
This statement marks the beginning of an entity's task definitions.
### Task Statements

These instruct the entity to do various tasks. They can be considered to be written and parsed in reverse-reverse-Polish notation. i.e. each statement has a temporary data stack, which can hold both data and entities. Values are added to the data stack beginning at the end of the statement, and working back to the beginning. For example, the statement
```remember Wolf1 howl Wolf1 howl Wolf2```
works like this:
1.Put Wolf2 on the stack.
2.```moan``` causes the top stack element, Zombie2, to be replaced by its remembered data value.
- Put Wolf1 on the stack.
moan causes the top stack element, Zombie1, to be replaced by its remembered data value.
- Put Wolf1 on the stack.
remember causes the top stack element, Zombie1, to remember the sum of all elements in the stack.
The following task statements are defined in ZOMBIE. They all instruct the entity on top of the data stack to do something. If the top value on the data stack is not an entity, the calling entity is the one that does the command.
animate [entity-name]
Activates a new copy of the named entity, if it is an inactive zombie.
banish [entity-name]
Immediately deactivates the entity.
disturb [entity-name]
Activates a new copy of the named entity, if it is an inactive ghost.
forget [entity-name]
Instructs the entity to forget its remembered data value.
invoke [entity-name]
Invokes a new copy of the named entity.
moan [entity-name]
Instructs the named entity to moan its remembered data value, and to keep remembering it.
remember [entity-name]
Instructs the entity to remember the sum of the values in the statement stack. Since a zombie can only remember one thing at a time, this causes it to forget any previously remembered value.
say [entity-name] text
Print the text to the standard output. (It doesn't matter what entity does this, as the result is the same.)
Flow Control

shamble ... until variable
Causes the entity to repeat the statements between shamble and until until the variable evaluates to true.
shamble ... around
Causes the entity to repeat the statements between shamble and around in an infinite loop.
stumble
Causes the current task to become inactive immediately.
taste variable good ... bad ... spit
If the variable evaluates to true, causes the entity to perform the statements between good and bad, otherwise perform the statements between bad and spit.
Operators

remembering [entity-name] variable
Boolean operator that evaluates to true if the entity is currently remembering a data value equal to the given variable, false otherwise.
rend
This operator pops the top two value off the statement stack, divides the second value by the top value, and puts the result back on the statement stack.
turn
This operator replaces the top value of the statement stack with its negative.
